        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Love Blooms was founded in 2015 with a simple yet profound mission: to help people express their deepest emotions through the timeless language of flowers. What began as a small family-owned shop has blossomed into a beloved floral boutique known for its exquisite arrangements and personalized service.</p>
        <p>Our journey started when our founder, Sarah, realized how a carefully selected bouquet could convey feelings that words often struggle to express. Inspired by this revelation, she dedicated herself to creating a space where love and beauty could flourish through floral artistry.</p>

        <p>At Love Blooms, we believe that every flower tells a story. We carefully source our blooms from sustainable local farms whenever possible, ensuring that each petal is as fresh and vibrant as the emotions they represent.</p>
        <p>We understand that when you choose to send flowers, you're entrusting us with your most precious sentiments. That's why we approach each arrangement with dedication, creativity, and attention to detail, crafting floral expressions that are as unique as your feelings.</p>
